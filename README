Unisync Server
==============

Unisync is a bi-directional live syncing solution that makes use of:

unison (http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/)
lsyncd (https://github.com/axkibe/lsyncd)

Unisync is a collection of bash scripts that combine these tools to
sync a directory tree with a remote host in real time.

============
Installation
============

Consult the INSTALL file for information on how to install the unisync
client.

=============
Configuration
=============

On the first run, unisync-server will create a ~/.unisync directory
and place a skeleton configuration file name unisync-server.lua. This
configuration file is simply part of the lsyncd configuration and
thus, you may consult the lsyncd documetation for the syntax. Once the
correct information is in this file, you should be able to run
unisync-server to start the server.

Further configuration is provided in the
/etc/unisyncd/unisync-server.conf file

=======
Running
=======

Starting the unisync server is as simple as running unisync-server
from the command line
